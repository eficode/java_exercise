Hello and welcome to test your coding skills! 

There are a couple of tasks listed below that you should try to solve.
But before you start those tasks you need to install some software to your computer.

You need:
 - Java development kit
 - Maven
 - MongoDB
 - Some code editor (IDE), Eclipse for example
 - You might need to set JAVA_HOME environment path variable
 
 
 1. Setup your development environment and install JDK, Maven, MongDB, Eclipse (or IntelliJ Idea or VS Code...) 
 2. Extract zipped codes and import project to your code editor.
 3. MAIN TASK: Compile the project and take a screenshot/text snippet from the logs that shows successful results. You might need to fix some bugs before that.
 4. TASK 2: Answer the questions that are commented in the code. You can add new comment lines below questions and write your answers there.
 5. Compress your fixed and commented code to .zip file and send it back to us.
 6. BONUS TASK: Set up MongoDB environment, add Collections there and insert some data there. 
    Run your compiled binary and use your web browser / some REST client to get data from MongoDB.
    Take a screenshot that shows the url you are using and the fetched data. Data should look something like in the picture (ExampleJson.PNG).

    - Use some other employer name in your example (don't use "John Doe") and you can insert data to those fields that are null in example picture.
    - If you are not familiar to MongoDB, tell us what database(s) you have used before and how many years you have experience.
